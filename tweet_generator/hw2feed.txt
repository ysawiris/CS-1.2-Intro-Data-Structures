post: Hi all,  Two Monday updates:  1) It would, belatedly, help me if we do who’s who slides. Link here: <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19VW5T6X19D8CyCia-v1qS1PyJwvreiWy0FaOjPqnPoM/edit> . There’s a template with suggested prompts, but I am always reluctant to ask students to do yet another one, so if you would rather just paste a slide you usually use, that’s okay too.  2) You should now have access to repositories for Class Code (<https://github.com/hcde310a19/ClassCode>) and Solutions (<https://github.com/hcde310a19/Solutions>). As we start working with more files, that will be easier than downloading the code from Canvas. If you use the solutions repository, you can either download zip files from the web or check out the repository in git. Many of the files contain class exercises, so to avoid version conflicts (as I/we release code for future weeks), many students find it easier to copy the code to another folder before working with it. If you *don’t* have access to either repository, you may need to accept an invite to the Students team on Github, or I may need to re-invite you (just Slack me).  See you this afternoon!  Sean

post: For part 3, you can include (or remove) newline characters. I changed this in revising the homework, but missed a spot, we’ll accept either.

post: Hi, I have a quick question. For hw1-part1 2d, should we print the last three characters of s (directions on canvas) or the last four characters of s (directions on the file/github)?

post: For hw1-part3.py, I accidentally ran my code against an old version of the feed. Your output from hw1feed.txt should be more like: ```1564 characters 16 lines 277 words``` Note that the line count may vary by one.

reply: So uploading separately (as-is) is probably easiest for you and no problem for us.

reply: Sorry about that inconsistency! Either is okay for this assignment; Canvas has gotten better about how it shows instructors multiple files.

post: Hi, I have a question about what to turn into canvas for homework 0.  In the readme, in “What to hand in via Canvas &amp; Github Classroom”, it says:  &gt; 1. Attach a single document (PDF preferred), containing &gt;  - A screenshot of running your edited hw0.py (part 6) &gt;  - Text you write for parts 7 and 8, in hw0.txt  Later in “Finally, turn hw0 in” it says:  &gt; To turn it in on Canvas, visit the course page, click on assignments, find hw0, and upload hw0.py, hw0.txt, and your screenshot.  Would you prefer hw0.txt and the screenshot as one pdf, or should we upload them as is?

post: If you are on Mac and getting told that you have to agree to the Developer prompt, there are two ways to do that:  1) space through the prompt it in terminal until you get to the place where it asks you to agree. The first times I tried this, I spaced right past that, but eventually got it. 2) Alternatively, opening xcode and clicking agree *should* work, though sometimes that dialog box doesn’t open.
