Nigga why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go
Tell me, girl why you be stressin' me for time?
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb?
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

Ain't a way around it no more, I am the greatest
A lotta niggas sat on the throne, I am the latest
I am the bravest, go toe to toe with the giants
I ain't afraid of you niggas, I'll end up fading you niggas
'Fore it's all said and done, this nigga need medicine
My uzi, it weighed a ton, I need me a better gun
In fact I just might need two, cause niggas say they the one
And I got something to prove
Forgive me lord here they come, BLAOOW

Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

My inhibition's fighting my intuition
Premature premonition, showing me the demolition
Of these phony niggas, so ahead of my time
Even when I rhyme about the future I be reminiscing
You want the truth well come and listen
I'm like that time you bagged a dime and checked ya phone and saw it was a number missing
As fate passes you by, half of you try
The other half of you fry, too high to actually fly
One day y'all have to decide, who you gon' be
A scary nigga or a nigga that's gon' rule like me
Keep it true like me, Cole you might be
Like the new Ice Cube, meets the new Ice-T
Meets 2 Live Crew, meets the new Spike Lee
Meets Bruce like Wayne, meets Bruce like Lee
Meets '02 Lil Wayne, in a new white tee
Meets KD, ain't no nigga that can shoot like me! BLAOOOW

(Who's the king?)
Came from the bottom nigga, with stains on my shirt
What you expected from me, I came from the dirt
(Who's the king?)
Money my motivator, the songs that I sing
Picture a peasant passin' from pawn to a king
You tell me ya still love me, if so then let me go
Will I return or will I burn, never know
Look in my eyes and see the future
But don't sugar coat it

Listen
History repeats itself and that's just how it goes
Same way that these rappers always bite each others flows
Same thing that my nigga Elvis did with Rock n Roll
Justin Timberlake, Eminem and then Macklemore
While silly niggas argue over who gon' snatch the crown
Look around, my nigga, white people have snatched the sound
This year I’ll prolly go to the awards dappered down
Watch Iggy win a Grammy as I try to crack a smile
I'm just playin', but all good jokes contain true shit
Same rope you climb up on, they'll hang you with
But not Jermaine, my aim too sick
I bang nigga, I came to bring the pain my brain too quick
You see how I maneuver this game, I ain't stupid
I recognize that life is a dream, and I dream lucid
And break the chains and change minds
One verse at a time, and claim 2-6
And fuck it, if the shoe fits, who's the king?

We all kings
(We all kings nigga)
Kings of ourselves first and foremost
(True)
While the people debate who's the king of this rap game
Here comes lil' ol' Jermaine
With every ounce of strength in his veins
To snatch the crown from whoever y'all think has it
But rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it
Poof, boom, paow, it's like magic
With a flash and a BANG the crown disintegrates
And falls to the Earth from which it came
It's done
Ain't gonna be no more kings
Be wary of any man that claims
Because deep down he clings onto the need for power
The reality, he's a coward
Ultimately he's scared to die
And sometimes so am I
But when I'm in tune with the most high
I realize, the fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side
Today I know that we are the same, are the same, you and I
Different kind of skin, different set of eyes
Two different minds, but only one God
(It's only one God nigga)
It's for all the kings
Cause I know deep down every poet just wanna be loved

Kendrick Lamar 
Me and my niggas tryna get it, ya bish
Hit the house lick tell me is you with it, ya bish
Home invasion was persuasive
From nine to five I know it's vacant, ya bish

Dreams of living life like rappers do
Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool
I fucked Sherane and went to tell my bros
Then Usher Raymond "Let It Burn" came on

Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen, ya bish
Park the car then we start rhyming, ya bish
The only thing we had to free our mind
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs

You looking like a easy come-up, ya bish
A silver spoon I know you come from, ya bish
And that's a lifestyle that we never knew
Go at a reverend for the revenue

It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison tell me what you do
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun, forever)

And I been hustlin' all day,
This a way, that a way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's just how I feel, nah, nah

A dollar might just fuck your main bitch
That's just how I feel, nah
A dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with
That's just how I feel, nah, nah
A dollar might just make that lane switch
That's just how I feel, nah
A dollar might turn to a million and we all rich
That's just how I feel

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Dreams of living life like rappers do
Bump that new E-40 at the school
(we at the school)
You know, “Big Ballin' With My Homies”
Earl Stevens had us thinking rational

Back to reality we poor, ya bish
Another casualty at war, ya bish
Two bullets in my uncle Tony head
He said one day I'd be on tour, ya bish

That Louies Burger never be the same
(won't be the same)
A Louis belt will never ease that pain
But I'mma purchase when that day is jerkin'
Pull off at Church's with Pirellis skirtin'

Gang signs out the window, ya bish
Hoping all of 'em offend you, ya bish
They say your hood is a pot of gold
And we gon' crash it when nobody's home

It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison tell me what you do
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun, forever)

And I been hustlin' all day,
This a way, that a way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's just how I feel, nah, nah
A dollar might just fuck your main bitch
That's just how I feel, nah
A dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with
That's just how I feel, nah, nah
A dollar might just make that lane switch
That's just how I feel, nah
A dollar might, turn to a million and we all rich that's just how I feel

Be the last one out to get this dough? No way
Love one of you bucket-headed hoes? No way
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way
Hit the brakes, when they on patrol? No way


Imagine Rock up in them projects where them niggas pick your pockets
Santa Claus don't miss them stockings,
Liquor spilling pistols popping
Baking soda YOLA whipping,
Ain't no turkey on Thanksgiving
My homeboy just domed a nigga,
I just hope the Lord forgive him

Pots with cocaine residue,
Every day I'm hustling
What else is a thug to do
When you eat cheese from the government
Gotta provide for my daughter n'em,
Get the fuck up out my way, bitch
Got that drum and I got them bands
Just like a parade, bitch

Drop that work up in the bushes,
Hope them boys don't see my stash
If they do tell the truth,
This the last time you might see my ass

From the gardens where the grass ain't cut,
Them serpents lurking blood
Bitches selling pussy, niggas
Selling drugs but it's all good

Broken promises, steal yo watch and tell you what time it is
Take your Js and tell you to kick it where a FootLocker is

In the streets with a heater under my Dungarees
Dreams of me getting shaded under a money tree

It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison tell me what you do
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun, forever)

And I been hustlin' all day,
This a way, that a way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's just how I feel

Kendrick, just bring my car back, man. I called in for another appointment. I figured you weren't gonna be back here on time anyways.
Look, shit, shit, I just wanna get out the house, man. This man, on one, he feeling good as a motherfucker.
Shit, I'm tryna get my thing going, too. Just bring my car back.
Shit, he faded. He feeling good. Look, listen to him!

Girl, girl, I want your body, I want your body, 'cause of that big ol' fat ass. Girl, girl, I want your body, I want your body, 'cause of that big ol' fat ass.

See, he high as hell. Shit, and he ain't even tripping off them damn dominoes anymore. Just bring the car back!

Did somebody say dominoes?
